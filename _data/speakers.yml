  surname: "Odili"
  company: "Google"
  title: "Developer Ecosystems Community Manager"
  bio: "Hello there! I am Charles Odili from Lagos, Nigeria. With a background in Computer Engineering at the University of Benin, I quickly picked up deep interest in programming and have been coding since 2005. In 2007 I joined Xchequer, a Port HarCourt based startup, and lead the development of prototypes for an NFC payment system. Two years later (2009), I was back at the University of Benin as Web Developer /  Webmaster,  joining a team that revamped the Institutions websites and online presence, leading to several very impressive consecutive Webometric rankings in Africa and cool internal apps including Memoticks which I personally built with GWT/Errai. I am very passionate about technology and how it can serve to improve lives, thus I co-authored a book in 2012, started GDG Benin in 2014, and also helped kickstart startups. I am currently the Google Developer Ecosystems Community Manager for Google in Sub Saharan Africa."
