  title: "Software Engineer"
  bio: "Not much is known about Tomiwa, however, information from our sources indicate that he is a software engineer that takes pride in creating software in the simplest of ways. To do this, he leans on the shoulders of open source giants using  their collective wisdom and conventions to guide design and development choices. During the day, he creates useful features for his customers and at night, he practises design thinking. There are rumours (though unconfirmed) of his interest in machine learning."

  title: "Developer Ecosystems Community Manager"
  bio: "Hello there! I am Charles Odili from Lagos, Nigeria. With a background in Computer Engineering at the University of Benin, I quickly picked up deep interest in programming and have been coding since 2005. In 2007 I joined Xchequer, a Port HarCourt based startup, and lead the development of prototypes for an NFC payment system. Two years later (2009), I was back at the University of Benin as Web Developer /  Webmaster,  joining a team that revamped the Institutions websites and online presence, leading to several very impressive consecutive Webometric rankings in Africa and cool internal apps including Memoticks which I personally built with GWT/Errai. I am very passionate about technology and how it can serve to improve lives, thus I co-authored a book in 2012, started GDG Benin in 2014, and also helped kickstart startups. I am currently the Google Developer Ecosystems Community Manager for Google in Sub Saharan Africa."
